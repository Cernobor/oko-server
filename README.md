## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Central server for the [OKO](https://github.com/Cernobor/oko-app) app.
Manges users, provides map tiles and the whole map tile pack, receives geo features submitted by users and serves them back.

## üèó Building <a name = "building"></a>

The only requirement to build the server is [go](https://go.dev).

In the root of the project, run

```
go build
```

which will produce the executable ``oko-server`` which you can just run (see [Usage](#usage)).

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

### Using docker

Dockerfile is included, therefore to build the docker image, all that is needed to do is to run

```
docker build -t name:tag /path/to/the/root/of/the/repository
```
or, if you have no local changes, you can build the image even without cloning the repository at all
```
docker build -t name:tag https://github.com/Cernobor/oko-server.git
```

The image can then be run using the ``name:tag`` that you have given in the previous step.
Volume ``/data`` is available to share data between the host and the container.

```
docker run -v /path/to/data:/data name:tag [options...]
```

### Without docker

Just run the previously built (see [Building](#building)) executable
```
/path/to/oko-server [options...]
```

### Options

The server is configurable via a set of options, some of which are required.
The table of options follows:

| option | description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| ``-tilepack <path>`` | **Required.** File that will be sent to clients when they request a tile pack, also used to serve tiles in online mode. |
| ``-port <port>`` | Port where the server will listen. Default is ``8080``. |
| ``-dbfile <path>`` | Path to the sqlite3 database file used for data storage. Will be created, if it does not exist upons startup. Default is ``./data.sqlite3``. |
| ``-min-zoom <int>`` | Minimum supported zoom. Clients will receive this value during handshake. Default is ``1``. |
| ``-default-center-lat <float>`` | Latitude of the default map center, formatted as a floating point number of degrees. Clients will receive this value during handhake. Default is ``0``. |
| ``-default-center-lng <float>`` | Longitude of the default map center, formatted as a floating point number of degrees. Clients will receive this value during handhake. Default is ``0``. |
| ``-max-photo-width <int>`` | Maximum width of stored pohotos. Uploaded photos exceeding this width will be rescaled to fit (keeping aspect ratio). If ``0``, no scaling will be done. Default is ``0``. |
| ``-max-photo-height <int>`` | Maximum height of stored pohotos. Uploaded photos exceeding this height will be rescaled to fit (keeping aspect ratio). If ``0``, no scaling will be done. Default is ``0``. |
| ``-photo-quality <int>`` | JPEG photo quality. Photos are reencoded to JPEG with this quality setting when uploaded. Default is ``90``. |
| ``-debug`` | If specified, logging level will be set do debug instead of info. w
